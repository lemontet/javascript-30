# JavaScript30

## About
This repo follows the 30 Day Vanilla JS Coding Challenge with Wes Bos: Build 30 things in 30 days with 30 tutorials. No frameworks, compilers, libraries or boilerplate.

Grab the course videos at [https://JavaScript30.com](https://JavaScript30.com), and the starter code from [Wes's Github](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30).

## Repo structure
Each challenge completed typically includes two code files for reference, like this:

```
.
├── 01 - JavaScript Drum Kit
│   ├── index-ME.html  >> Solution written by me
│   ├── index-WES.html  >> Solution provided by Wes
│   └── style.css
└── README.md
```

On some challenges a README is included to document key learnings.

Have fun!
