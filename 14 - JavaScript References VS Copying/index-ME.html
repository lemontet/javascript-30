    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2); // 100 100
    age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2); // 200 100

    /* Strings numbers and booleans take variable values (not the reference)
    So if the value of the original var changes, copies don't */

    // Let's say we want to copy an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;
    // console.log(players, team);
    // But what happens when we update that array?
    team[0] = 'Pongo';
    // console.log(players, team);
    // Oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. 
    // They both point to the same array! How do we fix this? 
    // We take a copy instead!
    players[0] = 'Wes';

    // Copy Array Method #1 - Slice the array!
    const teamSlice = players.slice(); // Return the entire array    // console.log(teamSlice);
    
    // Copy Array Method #2 - Concat old array to a blank new one
    const teamConcat = [].concat(players);

    // Copy Array Method #3 - Use the new ES6 Spread Operator
    const teamSpread = [...players];

    // Copy Array Method #4 - Use Array.from
    const teamArrayFrom = Array.from(players);
    // console.log(teamArrayFrom);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // OBJECTS: The same thing goes. Let's say we have a person object

    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      social: {
        email: 'wes.bos@bossman.co',
        twitter: '@wesbos'
      }
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const doppelganger = person;
    // doppelganger.age = 99;
    // console.log(doppelganger);

    // Copy Object Method - Object.assign (but there are conditions...)
    const notDoppel = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 99})
    // The first layer is a copy; anything deeper is a reference
    notDoppel.social.email = 'lies@deception.co'
    console.log(notDoppel);
    console.log(person);

    // We will hopefully see the object ...spread soon


    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects.
    // lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it
    // because very rarely do you ever need to clone an object that deep.
    // Plus, you should consider performance impact of a function like that.

    // Deep copy Object (with caution) Method - Object to JSON to string
    // AKA. "The poor man's deep clone"
    const deepObjCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
    // Comes with a performance cost
